  "summary": "The diff implements removal of Email from the Contact page and footer, and removal of Facebook from Follow Us sections in Contact and Footer. It also updates metadata/documentation-like files that mention additional unrelated features/changes not part of the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Updated project metadata/summary to describe broader product direction (e.g., shifting away from ordering/checkout and referencing WhatsApp/email/phone) beyond the specific request to remove Email/Facebook UI.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asked to remove Facebook from Follow Us and remove Email from Contact and footer; it did not request changes to project summaries/metadata describing broader feature scope.",
      "evidence": [
        "project_state.json (truncated): summary includes \"Shift away from online ordering/checkout\" and mentions \"WhatsApp/email/phone\""
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Updated repository file summary text that references numerous unrelated features/components (cart context, checkout, share/publish dialog, sticky cart button changes, etc.).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest scope is limited to removing Email/Facebook UI and ensuring the app builds; it does not request updating a file-inventory/summary document or introducing/mentioning other features.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (truncated): entries referencing cart/checkout components and \"Publish\"/\"share dialog\" strings"
