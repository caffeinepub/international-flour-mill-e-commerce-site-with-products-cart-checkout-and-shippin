# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish the current draft to the live (production) site and provide a stable, publicly shareable live URL.

**Planned changes:**
- Deploy the latest build to the production/live environment so it updates the public site URL.
- Update the in-app Publish/Share flow to display the correct live public URL in the Share dialog.
- Add/verify one-click “Copy Link” behavior in the Share dialog with visible success feedback.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open the app, click Publish to see the correct live public URL, copy it with one click, and share a link that loads successfully for anyone (including unauthenticated/incognito visitors).
